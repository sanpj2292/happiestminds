# HappiestMinds Coding Challenge

<h5>Instructions</h5>
1) Upload a txt file
2) Check for the Success message
3) Search for the exact word
4) If the word matches with the ones in the document
meaning, synonym & antonym of the word will be displayed
if available in PyDictionary API

<h5>Technologies Used</h5>
1) Backend - Python(Flask)
2) Database - MongoDB
3) Frontend - HTML & CSS(Bootstrap)
4) Templating - Jinja2

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
1) Python3.7 needs to be installed
2) All the required libraries are to be installed from PipFile
3) Then from the folder of the application run `python run.py`(for Windows)
4) Install MongoDB from it's official website
5) Navigate to the MongoDB's bin folder, open command prompt
& run `mongod.exe --dbpath X:\my_pa_folder\my_data\data\db`

*Note*: 
1) We would need to create the data folder beforehand & provide
the path to the above mongodb command to make sure the db is
running in localPC
2) You don't need to do anything special for Jinja2 installation,
as Flask inherently takes care of it.
